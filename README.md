Random name generator
For this weeks Project I created an EC2 Instance Naming Automation for Multi-Department AWS Environments.

In a shared AWS environment with multiple departments, clear EC2 instance identification is key to efficient management. This Python-based tool automates the creation of unique EC2 instance names using department input and randomized identifiers. By simplifying instance naming and reducing ambiguity, the solution improves team collaboration, streamlines instance tracking, and enhances overall cloud resource management.
